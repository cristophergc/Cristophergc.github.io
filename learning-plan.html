   <h1><u>My Learning Plan Bootcamp</u></h1>
   <br>
   <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

      <p>My long term goal is to be a full stack developer and AWS or Azure solutions architect. 
         I would like to work in different countries to learn more about other cultures and to work for companies that incentive people growth and wellbeing.

   <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
         I am a full time student now so I can focus all my energy into learning. I believe I am a good team player, easy going and friendly, 
         so these would be my strengths for the bootcamp. Perhaps the lack of knowledge would be a limitation, but that is why we are studying, right?
      </p>

   <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
      <p>
         I believe the mental stress will be the biggest non-technical challenge. I put a lot of stress on myself to learn and get a job. 
         Dealing with people can also be challenging at times depending on their personality. 
      </p>

   <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
      <p>
         Self-awareness and reflection are the skills I am working on. I believe they are the core skills to help with all the others.
      </p>
   <br>

   <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
         To be patient, helpful and support the students technically and emotionally.  
      </p>

   <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
         I am a calm, easy going and outgoing person, so I have no problems expressing myself. I will be following all the instructions from the 
         teachers and the material and if I have any problems I will let them know. I believe this will be very enjoyable. I am looking forward.

    <h1><u>My Learning Plan Foundations</u></h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

    <p>My long term goal is to become a full stack developer within a year and be able to work from anywhere in the world. 
    My wife is also in technology, so we would like to live in different countries and spend some time closer to our families.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
    <p>At the moment, I am still working full time, so it has been quite challenging to get everything done. I only have one more week of work, 
       so that is good. My biggest challenge has been to understand JavaScript, but I believe I need lots of practice (even with HTML and CSS) to fix 
       the concepts in my mind. 
       I am a very dedicated student and I have been studying for 6 months most days. I really want to make this happen.
    </p>

    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of experience dealing with people, so I donâ€™t think there is much to develop here. This is my strongest part.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>How you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives?</h2>
    <p>I have been told by other developers, that I have to control my time in front of the screen and sleep well because is really easy to burnout 
       when you are learning to code. Working and studying with others is the best way of accumulating knowledge and practice your learnings. 
       I believe that you always get what you give.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h2>
    <p>Ask for help and guidance. My 2 best friends are software developers and I also have the school to support me. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    <p>Most of the daily problems I try to sort with google and my own notes. If I cant sort it by myself, I would try the school, 
       either a classmate or facilitator. If cant get help from the school for some reason, I would reach out to my friends.

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
    <p>Guidance, support and help when stuck.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
    <p>I am fully commited to studying at the moment. I go to the gym and play football to relax my mind. 
       I also play drums once a week to distract myself.
