        <p>
            In CSS, from the outside going in, first you have margin, than border, than padding and finally the content (your creation). 
            So your creation is surrounded by these 3 layers.
            Every single HTML elements is treated as a box by CSS, so you can adjust to your liking.
        </p>
            
        <h3>Margin:</h3>
            <p>
                A margin is the space around an element’s border, the space between the border and the next element of your design. 
                Think of the space outside the border and between it and the other elements. Like if you had one box next to the other, 
                the space between the boxes would be the Margin.
                Margin goes around all four sides of the content and you can target and change the margin for each side.
            </p>

        <h3>Border:</h3>
            Border is the box itself, the cardboard. It is what "separates the content from the outer world".

        <h3>Padding:</h3>
            <p>
                Padding is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. So if you had shoes inside the box, padding is the paper around the shoes,
                and the shoes are the contet.
            
                Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.

             Another way I could expain this to a non-technical person is, imagine a fish bowl in the middle of a room. The fish
            is the content, the water is the padding, the glass is the border and the walls of the room is the margin.
