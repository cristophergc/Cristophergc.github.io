    <h2>Understanding how the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>

        <p>
            When you understand the principles of Neuroplasticity, you eliminate some barriers that affect your learning performance. 
            This the ability the brain has to create new connections so we can learn, memorize and create some new abilities. 
            Most people believe they are not capable of doing something and there is nothing they can do about it. 
            When they understand how the brain works, it gives them hope and motivation to endure and create the new neural paths and learn.
        </p>

    <h2>How will you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h2>
        <p>
            I learned about neuroplasticity about 5 years ago when I decided to learn how to play drums. It was very hard in the beginning 
            but slowly I could feel the progress. I would try hard to do something and fail, but after a week or two, I would try again and 
            feel like my body was not struggling so much and slowly got to the point of becoming second nature. It could feel my brain creating 
            the path to make playing drums easier. This gave me a boost in confidence.
            Now I am studying and learning how to type using all my fingers. It hasn’t been easy, but I can feel the improvements slowly. 
            I doesn’t happen overnight, you must be patient.
        </p>

    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
            Never stop learning and believe in yourself. Be curious and eliminate the barriers that hold you back.

    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>what it is and why it is relevant?</h2>
        <p>
            A person with a growth mindset believes that she or he can get smarter, better, or more skilled at something through sustainable 
            effort – which is exactly what neuroplasticity tells us. You might say that growth mindsets simply accepting the idea of 
            neuroplasticity on a broad level.
        </p>

    <h2>How do I feel, what do I do and the blend with my Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>
            I already have it integrated. I have a whiteboard in my office, with some messages to remind me every day about my mindset. 
            I believe that Growth Mindset has everything to do with positive attitude. I have it clear in my mind that anything is possible. 
            It was a big decision for me to drop my current job to pursue this carrier. So the Growth Mindset is what will enable me to get where 
            I want to be.
