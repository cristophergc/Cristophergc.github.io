        <h1>Reflection Core Foundations</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                I started paying more attention to my emotional state and take the time to think about it. Our generation is not very patient, so we get frustrated quite 
                easily and we give up. 
                Thinking like a developer is also something I have been working on. Coding is something completely different from everything I have done before.
                Emotional Intelligence, Growth Mindset and Neuroplasticity are subjects the I have a lot of interest and enjoy reading. I have studied this subject before, 
                but this is something we should always be exploring to become a better person.

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>
                To be able to work in a team and enjoy it, to be able to create healthy relationships and grow.
            </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                I wasn’t expecting so much content in the core learning and how much emphasis there is in this subject. I really enjoyed, the contents are very interesting.

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                I didn’t think it was challenging, I enjoyed. 
            </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
            <p>
                Because that is a critical skill that most companies are looking for. People that can interact with others and work with others.
            </p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
            <p>
                Not at all. These are subjects to study all your life, to refresh your memory and to become a better person.
