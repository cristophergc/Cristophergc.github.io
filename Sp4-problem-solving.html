    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h2>This post is about my struggles and approach to problem solving. Lets talk about the time I:</h2>
        <h3>1. Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>

            <p>
                For the people that are new to programming, the first thing I would tell you to check when you have an error, is the 
                spelling. This has created so much unnecessary headache and stress to me. And don’t freak out, just read the error and 
                try to figure it out.
            </p>

        <h3>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
            <p>
                I can’t really say I have solved problems in an elegant way. I feel like most of the problems I had were a battle to get 
                it sorted. But the in the other hand It is very rewarding when you overcome a problem.
                
            </p>


    <h2>So...what was the problem?</h2>
        <p>
            Got stuck because I forgot to put a “;” at the end of a function. I wrote a lot of code without testing so it was hard to 
            find the problem. 
        </p>

    <h2>What problem solving techniques were used?</h2>
        <p>
            Most of the time first, I write down in plain English what I believe I should do. After that, I do a google research on 
            the topic. If not successful I ring one of my friends. 
        </p>

    <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
        <p>
            When you are a beginner it is frustrating most of the time. You may feel that this is completely out of your depth. 
            It is almost like if you were not learning anything. But if you keep pushing through, things start making sense slowly. 
            So every time you find the solution for a problem, it is very rewarding.
        </p>

        <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
        <p>
            I learned to be patient and to test your cade after every little bit you add to it.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
        <p>
            Thinking about the problem and figuring out the steps to solve it is a good way of exercising the logic thinking for me. 
            After that, Googling and trying will help you find the solution and/or change the way you approach it.
            It is great to ask for others opinion or help, most people go through the same when they are learning.
            Because I am a beginner, I use the refection to think about the challenges and calm me down not to panic or give up.
