      <h1 class="identityh1">Who is Cristopher Germuts? – values, ethics and strengths</h1>
      <p class="one">I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo" target="_blank">Sao Paulo city</a>, Brazil, a city with nearly 20 million people. In a place like that, you have to prove you are worth the job you have every day, you can be replaced very easily. This has influenced me a lot and I still have some f that in me.
            My friends and my wife always considered me the most hard worker, determinate and ambitious of the group. In my wedding, both of my best mates mentioned in their speech that my determination influenced their lives and carrier. I have been described many times by family and friends as the “hard worker”. This is very fulfilling for me because I believe “the harder I work, the luckier I get”. 
            I came to New Zealand alone, with little money and poor English. I worked hard to get my first Visa and worked harder to get my Residency. Soon after that, withing 5 years I had 2 companies going, and I was working day and night. The market I was in turned upside down and I lost everything I had, plus I created a massive debt with the bank.
            It was the worst time of my life, I had to start from zero again….actually had to start from -$40,000. I could have walked away from everything and not pay suppliers and all the people I owed money to, but I made the decision that if I was brave enough to create the debt, I should be brave and embrace the consequences. Now I look back, and I am proud of what I have done. I had to work in two jobs for two years to pay everything I owed.
            My family always had businesses and my grandfather was well known as a honest man. He has always been my hero, so my decision were always based on his principles. I wanted to keep the family name intact.
            I struggled with depression and panic attacks many times, since I was a teenager, so learning how to deal with it and getting over it a few times throughout my life, made me reflect a lot about what is important and what is that I really want for my future. Before I was looking for happiness, now I know it is not out there, it is inside me.
            All these events in my life shaped the person I am now, so I am glad I had those experiences.

    <h2 class="identityh2">Personality test:</h2>
    <p class="one">I have done some personality tests and the results came different in different times of my life. I don’t like putting a label on my personality because it makes me over thing about it. I am always working on being a better person. I know what type of person I want to be, I am always looking for improvements.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="identityh2">Strengths and limitations:</h2>
    
    <p class="one">I believe my biggest strengths are determination and focus. I am very committed to become a full stack developer. I can’t see any limitations at the moment apart of my job, but that I am finishing in a week.
    </p>

    <h2 class="identityh2">Resistance at work:</h2>
    
    <p class="one">When I started my current job as Operations Manager, I had a lot of resistance from the staff because of my age and lack of knowledge on 
      how the product was processed. I was younger than most staff, so they didn’t want to get orders from an immigrant younger than them. 
      I had to earn their respect, so for the first 2 months I spent most of my time working with them, wearing overalls and getting dirty. 
      I learned a lot from them and slowly they started respecting me and following my decisions. I had to do that with the truck drivers and the 
      outcome was also the same. This strategy was great and I wouldn’t have done any different now.
