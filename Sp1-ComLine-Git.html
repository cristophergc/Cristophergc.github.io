    <h1>The Command Line, Git and Github</h1>

    <h2>What is the Command Line?</h2>


    <img src="images/CommandLine.png" alt="Command Line Picture">
    <p>
        Command Line is where you use commands to navigate through your computer. Instead of using your mouse to open, close, save, 
        delete, copy and etc, you type it in. <br> It is like if you had access to the kitchen of a restaurant instead of sitting and using 
        the Menu and the waiters service.
        <h3>6 examples of Commands and what they do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pwd - print working directory (shows what directory you are in, all the way back to Home directory)</li>
            <li>ls - list of files and folders inside directory</li>
            <li>cd - change directory</li>
            <li>cd .. - go up (back) one directory</li>
            <li>mkdir - create a directory</li>
            <li>touch - create a file</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What is Git and Github</h2>

    <p>
        Git is a version control software which enables you to have multiple people working in the same project without overwritting 
        each others inputs.
        Github is a cloud service to keep the Git projects remotely for easy access and security.
