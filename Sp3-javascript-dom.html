    <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>

    <p>
        HTML is the language that creates the back bone of a website, the basic structure. CSS is the language that can communicate with HTML
        and make the content look better. CSS is what makes it beautiful and organized on the screen.

        To make an analogy, imagine you were GOD and instead of creating a website, you had to create a person. First you would create the
        basics of a body: head, arms, legs and etc. That would be the HTML part of it. After you finished that, you decide how you would 
        like that person to look like. You would chose the eye colour, hair colour, size of the nose and ears, how tall, how big or small 
        and etc. This would be CSS. JavaScrip would make the body move.
    </p>

    <h2>Control flow and loops explained using an example process from everyday life</h2>

    <p>
        So going back to playing GOD. You have your Human structure (HTML), looks (CSS) and motion (javaScript) ready. 
        So for the Human to function properly he has to do something things every day. He wake up, go hunt for food and water, 
        eat, drink and look for a shelter to sleep. That is the Control Flow in place, the things he has to do in sequence to function 
        properly. Within the Control Flow, that are some activities that has to be repeated for the Human to function properly. 
        He has to eat and drink repetitively until he is full. This is where the Loop comes in. He will repeat the eating and drinking a 
        few times until the desired level is reached. 
    </p>

    <h2>What is the DOM? Example of how you might interact with it</h2>

    <p>
        The DOM is like the text editor in your browser. You can play with your code and see the changes straight away. You can interact 
        with objects in an HTML document and use JavaScript to do the changes.
        When you load a web page, you can right click with your mouse and choose inspect, or press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J 
        (Windows, Linux) using your keyboard to open the DOM. If you click on elements you will see all the HTML and CSS elements and you can
         dynamically interact with it.

    </p>

    <h2>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>

    <p>
        The major difference is that Arrays store the data in an ordered collection in which the data can be accessed using a numerical index 
        and Object stores the data in key value pairs and they are accessed by their names.
    </p>

    <h2>What functions are and why they are useful</h2>

    <p>
        A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is like building a machine to create something. 
        You input something, the machine process it and deliver a product.
        Functions are important to remove the need to repeat large chunks of code and makes the program easier to read.
