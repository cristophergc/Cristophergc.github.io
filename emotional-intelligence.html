    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and those of people around you. People with high 
        degree of emotional intelligence know what they are feeling, what their emotions mean, and how these emotions can affect other people.
    This is essencial for leaders. There are 5 key elements to it:

            <li>Self-regulation</li>
            <li>Motivation</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <li>Social skills</li>
        </ol>
        Let's dig deeper itnto these elements.

        Being self-aware when you are in a ledership position also means having a clear picture of your strengths and weekness, 
        and it means behaving with humility.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Every time you face a challenge, or even a failure, try to find at least one good thing about the situation. It might be something small,
        like a new contact, or something with long term effects, like an important lesson learned. But there is almost always something positive, 
        if you look for it.
